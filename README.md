PBS Pro on cx1 now uses a queuejob hook to perform checks when a job is submited.

This hook is just a python script using PBS objects. The script itself is on:

cx1b:/root/PBS_PRO/hooks/submit

Its location is imaterial as PBS will import the script to an internal location.

The script can be updated and imported to PBS with:

qmgr -c "import hook submit application/x-python default submit.py"

The definition of the hook can be checked with:

qmgr -c "print hook submit"

and the current script that PBS holds with:

qmgc -c "export hook submit application/x-python default"

Errors generated by the hook can be checked on the server log with:

grep "Error - " /var/spool/PBS/server_logs/<date>
